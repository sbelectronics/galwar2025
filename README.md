Galactic Warzone 2025
Scott Baker, https://www.smbaker.com/

This project is a rewrite of the Galactic Warzone BBS Door Game.

Galactic Warzone (aka Galwar) was my first commercially successful software program,
written sometime around when I was 14-16 years old, which would have put in in the
mid-to-late 1980s.

The original game was wrritten in Turbo Pascal.

Why rewrite it? Why now?

Why not? For any programmer, it's fun to see how your skills have evolved. Looking
back at the original galwar code, it's quite primitive. Lots of cut and paste
coding. Lot's of brute force logic. Purely as an exercise, let's see what I can
do to modernize it.

Why in Go?

These days I'm a Go programmer, and it's a sensible modern language. By the time this
exercise is complete, we'll do a bit better than the original, probably supporting
multiple simulatenous users.

Will anyone use this?

I have no idea. The original Galwar is still available, and I would think most people
searching for nostalgia would simply run the original. Depending on how far I get with
this, maybe it may offer some more capability in the form of concurrent multiplayer
capabilities. I suspect most people will get bored rather quickly.
